# Binary-Up-Down-Clock
CSCE 211 Circuit Project


Using D and JK Flip-Flops, we created a base-60 counter to display a minute timer. 
It uses clocks and a single binary input to determine the up or down movement and manipulate a base-6 and base-10 counter for two separate seven-segment displays.

Depicted below are the derived K-Maps and Truth tables for the logic gates used to determine the flip-flop activity. 

Depicted first is the up-counter for the base-10 circuit, followed by the down-counter:

Depicted below are the base-6 counter, both up and then down, for the second circuit.
Since this circuit only uses a base-6 output, the implementation of D flip-flops was easier to use:
